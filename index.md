## Driving Directions and Parking

Campus parking is very limited and is not recommended. You can check available options here. The closest parking lot for visitors is located on the top floor of [Hopkins Parking Structure](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hopkins+Parking/@32.8837791,-117.2419775,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc06c1e6156103:0xc6690b999c002d97!8m2!3d32.8837791!4d-117.2394026!16s%2Fg%2F1jky0r__3?entry=tts). You can pay the fee in pay station or pay-by-phone. Note that most visitor spots are limited to two hours. Even though the app allows you to pay for longer periods, you will get a ticket after that time.
