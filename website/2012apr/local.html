        We will be meeting in the seminar room on the 6th floor (DBH 6011.)
        The building is located closely to the parking lot, indicated by the blue B in the image
        below.

        <b>Parking:</b>
        Unfortunately, parking is not free on weekends, because there are other events hosted
        at UCI at the same time and the parking office cannot make an exception for us.
        Parking at all UC campuses is, however, reciprocal, i.e., if you bring your parking permit
        from another UC campus, you can park on all corresponding parking lots.
        The nearest location is 12B just off East Peltason Drive, there is a parking machine there,
        so be sure to buy a ticket.
        The picture below indicates the parking lot as red letter A.
