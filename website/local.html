<br>
<p><b>Schedule:</b> 10:30 to 4:15, Saturday, May 2nd, 2015. Detailed schedule <a href="program.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Location:</b> Beckman Hall, room 103, One University Drive,
Orange, CA 92866.
On <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/about/_files/maps-and-directions/current-maps/campus-map.pdf" target="_blank">this
map</a>, Beckman Hall is building number 2 (see the "Buildings" box).
Room 103 is on the ground floor.

<p><b>Parking:</b> Display <a href="parkingPermit.pdf" target="_blank">this parking
permit</a> on the dash of your car.  

This permit is valid only for three parking areas: (LA) Lastinger
Structure, (AF) Argyros, and (BA) Barrera Structure.
On <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/about/_files/maps-and-directions/current-maps/campus-map.pdf" target="_blank">the
above map</a>, these parking areas are marked as LA, AF, BA (see the
"Parking" box).

The parking area closest to Beckman Hall is Lastinger Structure,
though Argyros is also very close.  Lastinger Structure is much larger
than Argyros, so Lastinger Structure is likely the best parking
option.
