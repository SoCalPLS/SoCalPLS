The SoCal Programming Languages and Systems Workshop will meet at
UC Irvine on April 21st, 2012.  SoCal is an informal gathering of
programming languages and systems researchers in the southern California
region.

The primary goals of this workshop include

  * Providing a friendly environment for students (and other researchers)
    to present their work.

  * Strengthening ties between local institutions.

  * Learning about cool stuff happening in PL and systems!

This SoCal meeting will consist of contributed talks.

REGISTRATION:

Due to a generous gift from Mozilla, we are able to lower the fee down
to a $5 registration fee that will be collected at the workshop to cover the
costs of food and incidentals. We can only accept cash or checks; please
make checks payable to Stefan Brunthaler.

*** Please notify Stefan Brunthaler  (s.brunthaler@uci.edu) in advance ***
*** that you plan to attend, so that we have enough food ordered.      ***
