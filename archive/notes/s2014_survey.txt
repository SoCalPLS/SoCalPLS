These are the results of a survey from the Spring 2014 version of SoCalPLS. I (
Ben Wiedermann) asked the following questions and transcribed respondents'
answers below.

  (1) How often should we have SoCalPLS? How long should it be, each time we
      have it?
  (2) Who (else) should come to SoCalPLS?
  (3) What should we do at SoCalPLS / how should we do it?
  (4) How much should SoCalPLS cost? Any other comments?
  
------------------------------
How often should we have SoCalPLS? How long should it be, each time we have it?
------------------------------

Two times a year seems too frequent if we are discussing completed work only.
Rather, the environment seems appropriate for discussing new, fresh ideas and
getting external perspectives / thoughts / directions. This would certainly be
worth taking advantage of.

Once per year

1.5 times per year

Twice a year for one day

One day

Every 6 ~ 9 months

------------------------------
Who (else) should come to SoCalPLS?
------------------------------

Why not people from industry (Google Santa Monica, Qualcomm Research)? Why not
have people (professors) give keynotes to inspire students?

I think that it might be interesting to bring in more people from different
disciplines and research industry labs.

Many of us at UCSB are collaborating with computer architects, and would be
interested in cross over. Not just from Architecture but other fields where PL
could have impact.

Some joint areas with PL like system or hardware.

Welcome more PL people: CalTech and many institutions
[Note: there's a list of SoCal academic institutions in the SoCalPLS repo. under
 notes/schools.txt --Ben Wiedermann]

USC, etc.

More institutions, more undergraduates

Industry people. Maybe they can bring sponsorship, too.

Invite everyone. Not all will show up.

------------------------------
What should we do at SoCalPLS / how should we do it?
------------------------------

I think talks are important venue to practice presenting material. Don't think
we should have fewer talks.

Longer tutorials (hands-on) would be cool for more mature projects like maybe
Liquid Haskell.

Ongoing work may be hard because lots of specialization. Really only very
initial exploration.

Ongoing work should definitely be part of this workshop -- in fact, I figured it
already was.

In the past, we've done "lightning talks" -- i particular I think this format
could be profitably applied to help people with their new ideas, in addition to
rewording the call for talks to encourage such submissions.

before SoCal: propose topics
during SoCal: break out into brainstorming sessions

debunking existing work: things we know are wrong in published papers

On-going work are more interesting. I prefer brain
storm more.

Existing work, ongoing work, and even some novel and random ideas

Would be great to have a day just for ongoing work. Or we could do a poster on
ongoing work.

Existing work

I like the 12 talks, each 15 minutes format that we had today

A much longer, before-lunch discussion session.

Ongoing work is useful for grad students.

More informal interaction rather than conference style talks.

No one will present ongoing work because they're afraid that their work is
stolen. Existing work is fine.

------------------------------
How much should SoCalPLS cost? Any other comments?
------------------------------

It's great that if we could have a forum / online group discuss different funny
things. Not only restrict to face-to-face talk.

More meat in lunch (this lunch is good :))

Free would be ideal. Maybe some corporate sponsors, looking to recruit.

The cost should be nominal for students.

Look for sponsorship. It doesn't cost a lot, they would be very happy to support
us I think.
