  <b>Language and Runtime Support for the Next-Generation of
    Distributed Applications</b>
  <br/>

  <h4 class="hdr">Abstract</h4>

  <p>

Large, scalable, distributed software systems are increasingly
implemented using collections of components to better manage software
complexity through reusability, modularity, and fault isolation. Since
each programming language has its own unique combination of
performance, speed of development, library support, and developer
communities, different software components are often implemented in
different languages.  For example, Ruby, Python, Java, and JavaScript
facilitate fast development of the web presentation layer, Java, PHP,
Perl, Python, and Ruby expedite development of efficient server-side
logic, and Java, query languages, and C++ are accelerate backend data
management. The components of these multi-language, multi-component
applications and mashups typically execute within independent runtime
systems (language virtual machines (VMs), interpreters, etc.) and
communicate and interoperate via remote procedure calls (RPC) and
message passing.</p>

<p>
Although, multi-language application composition provides many
benefits to programmer productivity and fault tolerance, it also poses
many challenges to traditional runtime and distributed system support.
  Such challenges include how to profile and characterize application
performance/behavior across language components and across
multi-language workloads, how to adaptively place of code and data to
make efficient use of distributed resources, and how to exploit
co-location of components (those executing on the same physical
resource) to improve communication performance between isolated
runtime systems.   Such support is increasingly important for
performance-sensitive applications that execute using systems that
simplify the use of distributed systems (e.g. clouds) by making
resources and services opaque to developers.  In this talk, we will
overview this execution model and the challenges it poses.  We will
also identify and  discuss new techniques that target and address
these challenges in a effort to facilitate high-performance for the
next-generation of distributed multi-language software.

Chandra Krintz is an Associate Professor at the University of
California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).  She joined the UCSB faculty in 2001
after receiving her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from
the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).  Chandra's research
interests include automatic and adaptive compiler, programming
language, virtual runtime, and operating system techniques that
improve performance (for high-end systems) and that increase battery
life (for mobile, resource-constrained devices).  Her recent work
focuses on programming language and runtime support for cloud
computing. Her group has recently developed and released 
AppScale&mdash;an open-source platform-as-a-service cloud computing system
that implements the Google App Engine (GAE) APIs that facilitates
next-generation cloud computing research.  Chandra has supervised and
mentored over 40 students, has published her work in a wide range of
ACM venues including CGO, ECOOP, PLDI, OOPSLA, ASPLOS, and others, and
leads several educational and outreach programs that introduce
computer science to young people, particularly those from
underrepresented groups.  Chandra's efforts have been recognized with
a 2006 NSF CAREER award, the 2008 CRA-W Anita Borg Early Career Award
(BECA), and the 2008-9 UCSB Academic Senate Distinguished Teaching
Award.</p>
