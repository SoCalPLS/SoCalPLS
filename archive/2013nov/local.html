      </p>

        <b>Parking:</b> Please park in Lot 9 (circled on the map
        below). If you have a parking permit from one of the UC
        campuses, it is valid at all UCs. If you do not have a UC
        parking permit, there is a kiosk (circled on the map, and labelled "i" for information)
        just next to the entrance to Lot 9 on Westwood Blvd., where you can
        purchase an all-day permit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Directions:</b> The following map shows the parking lot and
        Boelter Hall (each circled in red). Once you park, follow the red arrow on the map, enter
        the door at the southeast corner of Boelter Hall.  Walk on the <a href="http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/a-coded-message-hidden-in-floor-247232.aspx">Lo and Behold!</a> tiles up a small staircase, and Boelter 2444 is immediately on the right.  Interactive UCLA maps are
        available <a href="http://maps.ucla.edu/campus">here</a>.
