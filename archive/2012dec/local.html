      <p><b>Schedule:</b> 9:00 AM to 4:15 PM, Friday, Nov. 30, 2012. </p>
      <p><b>Location:</b>
        Winston Chung Hall, UC Riverside, CA 92521.
        We will be meeting in room 205/206 on the 2nd floor.
        The building is located just down the hill from the parking
        Lot 15, as shown on the map below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Parking:</b>
        You can get FREE parking in two ways.
<ol>
<li><i>If you have a long-term parking permit from one of the UC
  campuses,</i> the campuses have parking <a href="http://parking.ucr.edu/permits/reciprocity.html">reciprocity</a>, so stop by the kiosk and you'll get a daily parking
        permit for one of the UCR lots.</li><br>

<li>    <i>If you don't have a UC permit,</i> we have reserved 14
        complimentary UCR daily parking permits. Stop by the kiosk and mention
        you are here for SoCal PLS to pick up your permit. The 14 complimentary
        permits are issued on a first-come first-serve basis.</li>
</ol>
        <b>Directions:</b>
        The following map shows your route. First get off highway
        CA-60 (I-215N if coming from San Diego) at University Ave., then
        follow the red route to the kiosk and finally to parking Lot 15.
        The building, Winston Chung Hall, is at the bottom of the hill
        on the way you came in. Take the elevator or the stairs up to the
        2nd floor, make a right and walk about 45 steps until you get to 
        a patio (if you look up you'll see white sails).
        The meeting room 205/206 is on your right, through the door that says
        "No bicycles, rollerblades, skateboards ...".
